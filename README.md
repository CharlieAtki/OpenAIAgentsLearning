# OpenAI Agents SDK Playground

Welcome to my learning playground for the **OpenAI Agents SDK**!

This repository is focused on exploring and experimenting with the key concepts of the Agents SDK, including:
- 🧠 **Structured data extraction**
- 🛠️ **Tool definitions and execution**
- 🔄 **Agent handoffs and control flow**
- ⚙️ **Asynchronous function handling**
- 🧾 **Using Pydantic models for schema validation**

## 🧪 What I'm Learning

### ✅ Agents SDK Fundamentals
- Defining and registering tools with proper metadata.
- Creating custom agents and handlers.
- Understanding the flow between user messages, tools, and agent responses.

### ✅ Data Structuring with Pydantic
- Building reusable schemas for structured data (e.g. emails, tasks, meetings).
- Validating and parsing LLM outputs using strict schemas.

### ✅ Async Execution
- Running async tools in parallel or sequentially.
- Handling awaitables in multi-step workflows.

### ✅ Handoffs & Control
- Designing agents that can delegate tasks.
- Managing state between steps with context.
