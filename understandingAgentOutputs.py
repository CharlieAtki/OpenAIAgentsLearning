# Each of the classes below act as schemas, simular to what I've used for Express and MongoDB (Mongoose)
# The pydantic classes are used to define how the email_extractor agent should structure data.
# This allows me to iterate through the JSON structure to create the email summary.


# Why this works great with LLMs like OpenAI:
# The Agents SDK or function calling system can take your Pydantic schema and use it to:

# Validate and parse the LLM's raw output (string → structured data).
# Autogenerate JSON examples that match the schema during function calling.
# Catch missing or misformatted fields before they break your app logic.

# Ps, Mongoose (MongoDB) schemas could follow this same idea and be  used to structure LLM responses
# This would be relevant for MERN Stack applications

   Subject: Project Phoenix Update and Next Steps
   
   Hi team,
   
   I wanted to follow up on yesterday's discussion about Project Phoenix and outline our next steps.
   
   Key points from our discussion:
   - The beta testing phase has shown promising results with 85% positive feedback
   - We're still facing some performance issues on mobile devices
   - The client has requested additional features for the dashboard
   
   Let's schedule a follow-up meeting this Friday, June 15th at 2:00 PM in Conference Room B. The meeting should last about 1.5 hours, and we'll need to prepare the updated project timeline.
   
   Action items:
   1. Sarah to address the mobile performance issues by June 20th (High priority)
   2. Miguel to create mock-ups for the new dashboard features by next Monday
   3. Everyone to review the beta testing feedback document and add comments by EOD tomorrow
   
   If you have any questions before Friday's meeting, feel free to reach out.
   
   Best regards,
   Alex Johnson
   Senior Project Manager
